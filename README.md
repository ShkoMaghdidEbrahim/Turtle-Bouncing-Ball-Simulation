# Turtle Bouncing Ball Simulation

## Overview
This Python application uses the Turtle graphics library to simulate a bouncing ball animation. The program illustrates the ball's movement across a predefined area, demonstrating basic principles of motion, gravity, and energy dissipation. It's an educational tool that visually represents the bouncing motion of a ball with decreasing heights over time.

## Features
- **Graphical Bouncing Ball Simulation**: Depicts a ball bouncing horizontally across the screen, with each bounce decreasing in height.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows adjustments to the initial height of the ball and the ratio of energy dissipation after each bounce.
- **Motion Path Visualization**: The path of the ball is visualized, showing both vertical and horizontal movements.
- **Height Labels**: Each bounce's height is labeled on the screen, providing a clear understanding of the ball's motion.

## Running the Program
To run the Bouncing Ball Simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.
   - The `turtle` module should be available by default in Python's standard library.

2. **Execute the Script**:
   - Run the script using Python: `python <script_name>.py`.
   - A window will open displaying the ball's bouncing animation.

3. **Interact with the Simulation**:
   - The simulation starts automatically and runs through a series of bounces, demonstrating the decrease in height after each bounce.

## Customization
- You can modify the `X` variable to change the initial height of the ball.
- Adjust the `R` variable to change the ratio of energy dissipation (restitution coefficient) after each bounce.

## Educational Use
- This tool can be used in educational settings to demonstrate basic physics concepts such as gravity, kinetic and potential energy, and energy dissipation in a visually engaging way.

## Contribution
Contributions to enhance and improve this simulation are welcome, such as adding more physics features, optimizing the animation, or creating interactive elements.
